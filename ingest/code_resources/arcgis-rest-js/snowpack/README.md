# ArcGIS REST JS + Native Browser Modules

1. Run `npm run build` in the root directory
1. Run `npm i` in this directory
1. Run `npm start` to spin up the development server.
1. Visit [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).

**Note:** We have `workspaceRoot` configured because this is part of our monorepo setup. If you use ArcGIS REST JS with Snowpack yourself you likely won't need this.
