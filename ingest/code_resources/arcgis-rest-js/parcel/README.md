# ArcGIS REST JS + Parcel

1. Run `npm run build` in the root directory
1. Run `npm i` in this directory
1. Run `npm start` to spin up the development server.
1. Visit [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:8080).

**Note:** We currently point the `NODE_ENV` variable at the root of this monorepo to [resolve an issue with Parcel and monorepos](https://github.com/parcel-bundler/parcel/issues/1588). If you use ArcGIS REST JS with Parcel yourself you likely won't need this.
